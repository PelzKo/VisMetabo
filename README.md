# VisMetabo
VisMetabo is a prototype tool built to cluster metabolic data and to show the identified patient subgroups and there overlap with specified clinical phenotypes. This is done by using subspace clustering algorithms (Clique, COSA, DOC) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM).
It allows the user to identify and visualize clusters in metabolomic data and to evaluate whether the provided phenotypes significantly differ between the clusters using t-tests and chi-squared tests.
